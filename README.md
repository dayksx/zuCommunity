# zuCommunity
The Zu Citizenship Registry is designed to manage the citizenship of members from both online and real-life communities, such as Zuzalu, Crecimiento, or any proclaimed Network States. It handles the entire lifecycle of citizenship—from naturalization to expiration or revocation—using privacy-preserving methods.
